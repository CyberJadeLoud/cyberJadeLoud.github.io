When I first attempted this program I was confident in what I have learned so far, it's also super helpful to be able to reference the code skeleton and test your knowledge. I began writing and rearranging the lines based on the code skeleton I was viewing and the actual requirements of the program. I ran into a few issues with adding the conversions of the numbers that were imputed. I simply forgot how to word the conversions and ended up not being able to run my program smoothly for the first few runs. I left out some key ReadLine commands but quickly realized. Once that was fixed my program ran smoothly. I was very excited and amazed how it looked on the console.
